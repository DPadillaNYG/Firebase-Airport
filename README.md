### Assignment

I was tasked with having to make a website using Firebase and Moment.js to become more
familiar with sending and recieving things from databases. For this project I choose to
focus on flight schedules: Being in the administrator seat and updating an airport schedule
that automatically shows a timer counting down to it's arrival based on the current clock
while also updating it's departure time by accomadating 45m automatically. I referenced
alot of airport flight schedule screens for the look and decided to make an alternative
application for the RDU administration. The Raleigh Durham International Airport.

### Skills Learned

I learned many things while doing this project with the support of my wife
who is also a very talented programmer and Stack Overflow. Here are some things
I learned on the fly:

- recursive functions
- .format() - Moment.js
- .add() - Moment.js
- .diff() - Moment.js

**Also, feel free to refer to the comments within logic.js to see how I integrated:**

- Moment.js
- Firebase
- tables

### Comments

The biggest feature I added that I am most proud of would have to be the clock that counts
down once the flight schedule is added. It informs the public how long until the flight arrives
based on the current time. It also expires when the time has ran out. There was alot more I
would've like to have added to this project, but I had a huge group project incoming that I need
to devote all my time and energy too. I spent a good two to three days on this as opposed to my usual
week.
